This project hosts a collection of tools dedicated to Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) signals.

*pdmgenerator: Firmware for STM32 devices for generating PDM tones
*pdm2pcm: POSIX application meant to decode PDM signals and generate PCM output
*pdmgrabber: libftdi based application for acquiring in real time PDM signals using a Cypress FX2LP board
